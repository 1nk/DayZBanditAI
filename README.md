DayZBanditAI
============

The DayZ AI Bandit Module is a personal project built from a heavily stripped-down version DaiZy (DayZ SP), intended to simulate multiplayer gameplay in a singleplayer environment using AI Bandits to simulate the threat of hostile human players. 

The AI Bandit Module may be used in a multiplayer environment, but unpredictible events may occur due to variable locality issues. The AI Bandit Module is intended for use with Reality DayZ private hive server files in a lone player environment, but 
*may* also be compatible with DaiZy (Single Player DayZ) with appropriate modifications. 

The AI Bandit Module may be ported into any DayZ map with quick changes to loot data and AI spawn points.

Features of the DayZ AI Bandit Module:
---------------------------------------
* Varied, randomly-generated bandit loadouts
* Bandit equipment is balanced according to the location in which they are generated (ie: bandits in high-risk areas such as military bases tend to be better armed)
* Bandits tend to spawn and patrol near valuable buildings (ie: Barracks, Firestations, Supermarkets)
* Bandits respond to zombies and engage zombies on sight.
* Zombies detect bandit gunfire and seek out its source
