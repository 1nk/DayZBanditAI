DayZBanditAI
============

The DayZ AI Bandit Module is a personal project built from a heavily stripped-down version DaiZy (DayZ SP)intended to simulate multiplayer gameplay in a singleplayer environment using AI Bandits to simulate hostile human players. 

The AI Bandit Module may be used in a multiplayer environment, but has not been tested. The AI Bandit Module may be modified to be fully compatible with any DayZ map.

Documentation DayZ AI Bandit Module coming soon.
